=head1 NAME

Strategic::Wiki - Git and Plack based, lightweight wiki

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    > strategic-wiki init
    > edit .strategic-wiki/config.yaml
    > strategic-wiki make
    > strategic-wiki up

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Strategic Wiki (SW) lets you turn any directory on your computer into a
wiki. Every file in the directory is a wiki page. All SW files are put
into a C<.strategic-wiki/> subdirectory. SW uses git for wiki history.
If your directory is already a git repo, SW can use its GIT_DIR, or it
can set up its own. SW is a Perl Plack program, so you can run it in any
web environment. The 'up' command will start a local web server that you
can use immediately (even offline).

Strategic::Wiki installs a command line utility called C<stategic-
wiki>. This command can be used to create and update the wiki. It can
also act as a git hook command.
